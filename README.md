### **HEIFReader** & **HEIFWriter** for Android Guide Line.

- Convert from HEIC to JPG/JPEG/PNG.
- Convert JPG/JPEG/PNG to HEIC. 

------

### Prerequisite

- Android SDK: API 28 and above.
- Working well as Android 28+ (for HEIFWriter).

### Features

**HEIFWriter**

This project is a demo of a HEIFWriter from android developer as [link](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/heifwriter/HeifWriter). Please prefer any issue and welcome to pull request that we can discuss.

Code:

```kotlin
        // Using HEIFWriter from Google
        // https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/heifwriter/HeifWriter
        // Warning: Support from Android 9.0+ & Does not support by Emulator.

        // Step 1: Loading JPG.PNG.JPEG files from asset and convert it to YUV or Bitmap
        val bitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(assets.open("photo.jpeg"))
        val imageHeight = bitmap.height
        val imageWidth = bitmap.width
        val destination = "${Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES)}/photo.heic"
        Log.d("convertFile", destination)
        // Step 2: Create HEIF Writer instance & convert
        try {
            HeifWriter.Builder(destination, imageWidth, imageHeight, HeifWriter.INPUT_MODE_BITMAP)
                    .setQuality(90)             // Set Quality range [0,100]
                    .build().run {
                        start()
                        addBitmap(bitmap)       // addBitmap if the writer is using INPUT_MODE_BITMAP
                        stop(0)     // 0: mean infinitely running
                        close()                 // Close after use.
                    }
        } catch (ex: Exception) {
            // Throw exception in case the device is not supported like Android not above of 9.0 or cause by using Emulator
            ex.printStackTrace()
        }
```

**HEIFReader**

- Plan to use: [Nokia HEIF reader & writer](https://github.com/nokiatech/heif) & [mobileFFMPEG](https://github.com/tanersener/mobile-ffmpeg) to convert between HEIC and JPG/JPEG/PNG formats.
- How to do:
  - Build Nokia HEIF library and get the `aar` file.
  - Import to project.
  - Using **Nokia HEIF Library** to parse the data of HEIF format files.

```
				val heif = HEIF()
        // Step 1: Load file
        heif.load("HEIC.heic")
        // Step 2: Check type of HEIF format, cause it have many types: Still Image, Grid Image ... (Apple is using GridImage type for that format)
        when (heif.primaryImage) {
        	is GridImageItem -> {}
        	is IdentityImageItem -> {}
        	is OverlayImageItem -> {}
        	is HEVCImageItem -> {}
        	is AVCImageItem -> {}
        }
        
        // Step 3: In-case this is GridImageItem
        // Get size width, height
        val originalWidth = primaryImage.size.width
        val originalHeight = primaryImage.size.height
        // Getting original rotation degree of Original Image file
        val rotationDegree =
            (heif.itemProperties.findLast { it is RotateProperty } as? RotateProperty)?.rotation?.value
                ?: 0
        // Apple is using 48 tiles and join to 1 images, parse of its and then convert its to HEVC bitstream by FFMPEG
        for (rowIndex in 0 until primaryImage.rowCount) {
        	for (columnIndex in 0 until primaryImage.columnCount) {
        		 // Getting the tile image based column / row
             val hevcImageItem = primaryImage.getImage(columnIndex, rowIndex) as HEVCImageItem
             // Getting decoder config and then using mobile-ffmpeg to write to HEVC bitstream in local storage.
             ....
        	}
        	
        	// After getting 48 tiles as bitstream files, join its and merge into 1 files by ffmpeg.
        	....
        	// Loading Color profiles and attach it.
        	....        	
        	// Convert BitStream to JPG.JPEG.PNG file by FFMPEG
        	....
        	// Loading Exifdata and attach it.
					....
          // Delete temp files and finish convert.
        }
```

All of the code is still not publishing yet.

### **Demo**

I'm successfully do all the converting between HEIF format for Android and publish that code into Google Play as here. Try to test it and welcome any questions.
